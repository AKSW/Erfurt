# DBpedia Benchmark Data #

This folder must contain a "benchmark_data.nt" file, which contains the data that is used
in the DBpedia benchmark in n-triples format. The n-triples format is used because each
line is independent and can be parsed separately.

Because of its size the benchmark data is not included in this repository. Prepared data sets can be retrieved
from http://dbpedia.aksw.org/benchmark.dbpedia.org/. A description of the benchmark is available
at http://aksw.org/Projects/DBPSB.html.
