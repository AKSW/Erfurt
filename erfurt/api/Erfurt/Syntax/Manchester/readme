PHP Parser for Manchester Syntax in OntoWiki

Requirements:
All packages required for Parser and Lexer are already included in Erfurt/lib/PEAR.
If you want to update the packages, you can replace them with newer version from http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_ParserGenerator/ and http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_LexerGenerator

Updating Tokenizer:
Syntax of the PHP_LexerGenerator is similar to flex (http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/). For differences see http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_LexerGenerator.
To make changes to the Manchester Tokenizer edit the Lexer.plex file.
To generate Lexer.php, needed for Parser (Parser.php), execute generateLexer.php.

Updating Parser:
Syntax of the PHP_ParserGenerator is similar to lemon parser generator. For differences see http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_ParserGenerator/.
To make changes to Manchester Parser edit the Parser.y file.
To generate Parser.php, execute generateParser.php.

Currently supports only command line execution.
to test the parser from command line:

run starter.php your manchester syntax string
make sure, that your php executable includes the needed PEAR packages
